Why OpenCV is better choice the YOLO ?  
OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) serve different purposes and are not directly comparable in a "better or worse" sense because 
they address different aspects of computer vision and object detection tasks.

OpenCV:

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source library that provides a wide range of tools and functions for 
various computer vision tasks, including image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and more.
OpenCV is versatile and can be used for many computer vision applications, from basic image manipulation to more advanced tasks like 
face detection, image stitching, and augmented reality.
While OpenCV includes some object detection algorithms, it doesn't specialize in real-time object detection as its primary focus.


YOLO (You Only Look Once):

YOLO is a specialized real-time object detection algorithm that can detect and classify multiple objects in images and video frames simultaneously. 
It's particularly well-suited for tasks like object detection and tracking in real-time applications.
YOLO's strength lies in its speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for applications like autonomous vehicles, security cameras, and robotics.
So, whether OpenCV or YOLO is "better" depends on your specific use case:

If you need a comprehensive computer vision library for various tasks, including object detection but not limited to it, OpenCV is a great choice.
If your primary goal is real-time object detection and you want a fast and accurate solution, YOLO or similar deep learning-based object detection 
models may be more suitable.
In practice, you might even use both in combination. For example, you can use OpenCV for pre-processing and post-processing tasks (like resizing or 
drawing bounding boxes) in conjunction with YOLO for object detection to create a complete object detection pipeline.

So, the choice between OpenCV and YOLO depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
